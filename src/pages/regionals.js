                  While all our events and workshops are open to all, selection for the UCLA ICPC regionals team is based solely on performance in the annual tryouts (we ICPC officers have to try out too!) Each year, the top 12-15 performers in the tryout are invited to represent UCLA at the Southern California ICPC Regionals.

                  It is also worth mentioning that this tryout process is completely different from the application to join us as an officer! You need not be an expert at competitive programming to join us. All you need is a passion for teaching and problem-solving!

                  Absolutely! Team formation to left to be an organic process amongst the selected contests. Contestants form teams as they wish, typically after practicing together as a big group and identifying each individualâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. However, each contestant must tryout individually.
